# What is recommendation system?


## Humongous amounts of video content getting generated on a daily basis by organization, analyzing them is one of the biggest challenges. We need to build a content recommendation engine with userâ€™s viewing history and preferences. This will simplify content discovery for your users and guide them to the most relevant content that they want which in return saves organization time to analyse the popular/best videos.


Machine Learning algorithm used is NLP and TFID. 

HTML and CSS is used to design the page.


## Deployment

Deployed the model in streamlit. As this is easy platform to deploy the model.

To search the videos we exrtracted some keywords, if user search a video using keywords video will appear. And user will get some recommedation related user's searched videos.
Some variable had special characters and emoticons, we clean the data removed special characters and emoticons, using feature selection can reduce unnecessary variables from the dataset. So we created keyword variable as a target variable.
